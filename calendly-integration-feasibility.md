# Calendly Integration Feasibility Study
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Project:** YCAM Mentorship Program Portal  
**Requirement:** Automate One-on-One Coaching Session Tracking

## Executive Summary

**Feasibility:** ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Estimated Development Time:** 10-15 hours  
**Estimated Cost:** $1,500 - $2,250 (at $150/hour)

## Technical Requirements Analysis

### 1. Calendly API Capabilities

**Available APIs:**
- ✅ **Webhooks API** - Real-time event notifications
- ✅ **REST API** - Retrieve event data, user information
- ✅ **Event Types API** - Manage appointment types
- ✅ **Scheduled Events API** - Access booked appointments

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 or Personal Access Token
- Secure token storage in WordPress database

### 2. Webhook Integration Points

**Supported Events:**
- `invitee.created` - New appointment scheduled
- `invitee.canceled` - Appointment cancelled
- `invitee.rescheduled` - Appointment rescheduled

**Data Available:**
- Student email (to match with WordPress user)
- Appointment date and time
- Event type (coaching session)
- Status changes
- Cancellation/reschedule reasons

### 3. Database Schema Requirements

**New Fields for `tfsp_coach_sessions` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE wp_tfsp_coach_sessions ADD COLUMN calendly_event_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE wp_tfsp_coach_sessions ADD COLUMN calendly_uri VARCHAR(500);
ALTER TABLE wp_tfsp_coach_sessions ADD COLUMN auto_created TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE wp_tfsp_coach_sessions ADD COLUMN webhook_data TEXT;
```

**New Settings Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_tfsp_calendly_settings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    setting_key VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    setting_value TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: API Setup & Authentication (3-4 hours)
1. **Calendly Account Configuration**
   - Set up webhook endpoints
   - Generate API credentials
   - Configure event types for coaching sessions

2. **WordPress Integration**
   - Create Calendly settings page in admin
   - Implement secure token storage
   - Add API connection testing

### Phase 2: Webhook Handler (4-5 hours)
1. **Webhook Endpoint Creation**
   - Create secure webhook receiver
   - Implement signature verification
   - Add error handling and logging

2. **Event Processing**
   - Parse Calendly webhook data
   - Match student email to WordPress user
   - Auto-create/update coach session records

### Phase 3: Data Synchronization (3-4 hours)
1. **Automatic Session Creation**
   - Create sessions when appointments are booked
   - Set initial status as "scheduled"
   - Store Calendly event ID for reference

2. **Status Updates**
   - Handle cancellations and reschedules
   - Update session records automatically
   - Maintain audit trail

### Phase 4: Admin Interface (2-3 hours)
1. **Manual Status Updates**
   - Simple interface for coach to mark attendance
   - Options: "attended," "no show," "rescheduled"
   - Preserve automatic sync while allowing manual overrides

2. **Sync Management**
   - View sync status and errors
   - Manual sync trigger for missed events
   - Connection health monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Webhook Flow
```
Calendly → Webhook → WordPress → Database → Student/Admin Portal
```

### Data Flow
1. **Student books appointment** via embedded Calendly
2. **Calendly sends webhook** to WordPress endpoint
3. **WordPress processes webhook** and creates session record
4. **Session appears** in both student and admin portals
5. **Coach updates status** after appointment (manual step)

### Error Handling
- Webhook signature verification
- Duplicate event prevention
- Failed webhook retry mechanism
- Comprehensive logging system
- Email notifications for sync failures

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- ✅ Secure API token storage (encrypted)
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Rate limiting on webhook endpoint
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation

### Privacy Compliance
- ✅ Only necessary data stored
- ✅ Student email matching (no additional PII)
- ✅ Audit trail for all changes
- ✅ Data retention policies

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Hours | Rate | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|------|
| API Setup & Auth | 4 | $150 | $600 |
| Webhook Handler | 5 | $150 | $750 |
